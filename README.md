# DriverPass
The business requirements document and the system design document from my System Analysis and Design class.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass project detailed creating a Learning Management System that would allow students to study for the material tested at the DMV.
  This included an oneline LMS and an in-person appointment handler.
  There were 5 types of users; Student, Driving Instructor, Receptionist, IT Administrator, and Administrator.

What did you do particularly well?

  I was able to quickly deduce how I would program the system and just built charts according to my mental image.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  There are a few sections in the Business Requirements Document that I would add more details to.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I wanted to ensure that the user is able to request their information from anywhere.
  This caused me to have to design a sudo security method to allow for a much greater convenience for the students.
  The user is the one the system is made for, if they are not pleased then the client will be angry with the resulting system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I start with what I know I want to accomplish and then constructuct the things required to make that function.
  Creating the UML Class Diagram helped me create cleaner objects and I have already begun to add that to the beginning of my standard workflow.
